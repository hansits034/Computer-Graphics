# 🌌 Computer Graphics Projects  

This repository contains a collection of **Computer Graphics** implementations, assignments, and experiments.  
The focus is on **WebGL** and related technologies, showcasing various techniques in 2D and 3D graphics rendering.  

---

## 📖 Overview
The repository serves as:
- A portfolio of assignments and practice projects for computer graphics.
- A place to experiment with **WebGL**, **OpenGL concepts in the web**, and basic rendering pipelines.
- A demonstration of transformations, lighting, shaders, textures, and interactive scenes.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Implementations of **basic shapes** (cube, sphere, prism, etc.).
- **Transformations**: translation, rotation, scaling.  
- **Lighting & Shading**: ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections.  
- **Textures**: applying images to 3D models.  
- **Interactive Scenes**: user controls for movement, camera, and object manipulation.  
- Example projects such as:
  - 3D building/scene rendering
  - Car/Motor/Tree modeling
  - Maze or landscape generation
  - Simple animation demos

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **WebGL** – Core rendering API.
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – For structuring and scripting.
- *(Optional depending on repo)* **GLSL** – Custom shaders.  
- *(Optional)* **Three.js** – Higher-level abstraction (if used in any project).
